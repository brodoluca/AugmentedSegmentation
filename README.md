## Results so far:
- Lidar points clouds can be acquired using OpenCV and C++. Points can be stored as images. In this way, the images can be saved using reflectivity and distance. The other format to save point as is still to be defined. 
- The DL model is ready. It achieves 99% accuracy on the test dataset ([SqueezeSegV2](https://github.com/xuanyuzhou98/SqueezeSegV2)). Currently training an update version of the model (concatenation of the encoded vectors has been changed)
